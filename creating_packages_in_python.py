In python , 
after creating a new directory , you can create a new package with the  special class named __init__ 

This specifies to python to treat that directory as a package 
//In pycharm , this is done automatically when you select to create a new  python package 

You can find all pre packaged modules of python by googling 'python 3 module index '
